### ✅ **3. Organized Class Structure**
**File Changed:** `app.py` (init_db function)

**What Changed:**
- **4 Sections:** A, B, C, D
- **Each section takes 3 courses** (same 3 courses shared)
- Total: 4 sections × 3 courses = **12 classes**
- Faculty assigned based on department match
- Random but realistic room and schedule assignments

**Structure:**
```
🏫 Section A → 3 Courses (e.g., CS101, CS102, CS201)
🏫 Section B → 3 Courses (same as Section A)
🏫 Section C → 3 Courses (same as Section A)
🏫 Section D → 3 Courses (same as Section A)

Each section has:
  • 40 students
  • Enrolled in all 3 courses
  • Different faculty per course (based on department)
```

---

### ✅ **4. 30 Days of Attendance Data**
**File Changed:** `app.py` (init_db function)

**What Generated:**
- **30 days of historical attendance** (weekdays only)
- For each day:
  - Session created for each class
  - Attendance marked for all enrolled students
- **Realistic distribution:**
  - 85% present
  - 10% late
  - 5% absent

**Data Generated:**
- ~22 weekdays in 30 days
- 22 days × 12 classes = 264 sessions
- 264 sessions × 40 students = **10,560 attendance records**

---

### ✅ **5. Faculty Attendance Marking - FIXED**
**Files Changed:** `app.py` + `templates/faculty/mark_attendance.html` (NEW)

**What Was Wrong:**
- Old: Session detail page tried to do everything
- Confusing UI with QR code and marking mixed together
- Not clear what to do

**What's Fixed:**
- **Separate page for marking attendance**
- Clear instructions at the top
- Clean table with action buttons
- QR code in sidebar
- Real-time statistics
- Quick actions (Mark All Present/Absent)

**New Flow:**
```
1. Faculty creates session → Redirects to marking page
2. Clear table shows all students
3. Click Present/Late/Absent buttons
4. Changes save instantly (AJAX)
5. Statistics update in real-time
6. QR code available on the side
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Live statistics (Present/Late/Absent counts)
- ✅ Row highlighting on mark
- ✅ Quick action buttons
- ✅ Instructions panel
- ✅ Sticky QR code sidebar

---

### ✅ **6. University-Like Enrollment Structure**
**File Changed:** `app.py` (init_db function)

**Mimics Real University:**
```
🎓 Typical University Structure:
   ├─ Students divided into sections/batches
   ├─ Each section takes same courses together
   ├─ Different teachers for different courses
   └─ 3-4 courses per semester

✅ Our Implementation:
   ├─ 4 sections (A, B, C, D)
   ├─ 40 students per section = 160 total
   ├─ Each section enrolled in 3 courses
   ├─ Faculty assigned by department
   └─ Same course, different sections, different teachers
```

**Example Real Scenario:**
```
Section A students:
  • CS101 (Dr. Sarah Johnson)
  • CS102 (Prof. Michael Chen)
  • CS201 (Dr. Sarah Johnson)

Section B students (same courses):
  • CS101 (Prof. Robert Davis)
  • CS102 (Dr. Sarah Johnson)
  • CS201 (Prof. Michael Chen)

Different faculty teaches same course to different sections!
```

### ✅ **7. Notification System Explained**
**What Notifications Do:**

**Purpose:**
- Alert students about low attendance
- Remind them of attendance requirements
- Help them track their progress

**When Created:**
- Automatically when attendance drops below 75%
- During database initialization for students with low attendance
- When faculty marks a student absent

**Example Notification:**
```
⚠️ Low Attendance Alert

Your attendance in Database Management Systems is 68%. 
You need at least 75% to be eligible for exams. 
Please attend classes regularly.
```

**How Students See It:**
1. Badge on dashboard shows unread count
2. Recent 5 notifications on dashboard
3. Full list in Notifications page
4. Auto-marked as read when viewed

**Use Cases:**
- Student checks dashboard → Sees low attendance warning
- Student clicks Notifications → Sees all warnings
- Student improves attendance → No more warnings

## 🎓 Real University Scenario

### **Example: Monday Morning**

**Section A (Computer Science - 40 students):**
```
9:00-10:00   → CS101 with Dr. Sarah Johnson (Lab 101)
10:00-11:00  → CS102 with Prof. Michael Chen (Lab 102)
11:00-12:00  → CS201 with Dr. Sarah Johnson (Room 201)
```

**What Happens:**
1. Dr. Sarah Johnson creates CS101 session at 9:00
2. Goes to marking page
3. Students enter lab and scan QR code
4. Some students marked present via QR
5. Dr. Johnson manually marks remaining
6. At 9:50, she marks absent students
7. System checks attendance % for each student
8. If anyone < 75%, notification sent
9. Class ends, next session begins

**Student Experience:**
- Student arrives → Opens phone
- Scans QR code from projected screen
- "Attendance marked successfully!"
- Later checks dashboard → Sees 90% in CS101
- Feels good, continues to next class

**Late Student:**
- Arrives at 9:20 (20 mins late)
- QR expired, can't scan
- Dr. Johnson marks as "Late" manually
- Still counts toward attendance but flagged

## 📱 Notification System Details

### **Types of Notifications:**

**1. Low Attendance Warning**
```
Title: ⚠️ Low Attendance Alert
Message: Your attendance in [Course] is [%]. 
         You need at least 75% to be eligible for exams.
Type: low_attendance
```

**2. Future Enhancements (Can Add):**
```
- Upcoming class reminders
- Assignment deadlines
- Grade notifications
- Schedule changes
```

### **How It Works:**

**Trigger Points:**
1. **When marking absent:**
   ```python
   if status == 'absent':
       calculate percentage
       if percentage < 75%:
           create notification
   ```

2. **During database init:**
   ```python
   for each student:
       for each course:
           if attendance < 75%:
               create notification
   ```

3. **Badge Display:**
   ```python
   unread_count = Notification.query.filter_by(
       user_id=student_id,
       is_read=False
   ).count()
   ```
